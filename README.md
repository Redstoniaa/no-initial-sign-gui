# Sign Placement Cancel Editing
This is just a simple mod that achieves one purpose: to stop the sign text editing screen from showing up upon the initial placement of a sign (or any other type of sign, like hanging sign).

## Why? That sounds kinda stupid.
The 1.20 update brought a change to allow for signs to be edited after being placed down, meaning that the edit screen showing up upon sign placement is unnecessary, as you can just right-click it again afterwards to edit it. For most players, this isn't an issue, but some large scale builds may require large amounts of sign placement, which can easily get tedious as you have to exit out of the editing screen every time. This mod aims to help with that problem.

## Do I need to have it installed on the server for it to work?
Nope! The mod operates fully client-side, so there is no need for the server to have it installed for you to enjoy its benefits in multiplayer!

## What else do I need to make it work?
Not much! You just need:
- Minecraft version 1.20 or above (you can't edit signs after placement prior to 1.20 anyways)
- the latest Fabric loader
- **you don't need Fabric API**

## Is it toggleable?
I didn't see any need to make it toggleable, as you don't lose any functionality with this mod. You can just edit the sign after placing it down if you need to.
