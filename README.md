# No Initial Sign GUI
This is just a simple mod that achieves one purpose: to stop the sign text editing GUI from showing up upon the initial placement of a sign (or any other type of sign, like hanging sign).

## Why? That sounds kinda stupid.
The 1.20 update brought a change to allow for signs to be edited after being placed down, meaning that the GUI showing up upon sign placement is unnecessary, as you can just right-click it again afterwards to edit it. For most players, this isn't an issue, but some large scale builds may require large amounts of sign placement, which can easily get tedious as you have to exit out of the editing GUI every time. This mod aims to help with that problem.

## Is it toggleable?
I didn't see any need to make it toggleable, as you don't lose any functionality with this mod. You can just edit the sign after placing it down if you need to.

## Does it work fully client-side?
That's a good question, because I haven't tested it on a server! I will rewrite this thing if it doesn't work fully client-sided, because this should be of use to everyone, not just those on singleplayer worlds.
